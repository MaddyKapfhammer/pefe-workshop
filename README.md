# Prompt Engineering for Engineers - Collaborative Prompting Workshop

This repository contains example codebases used in the **Prompt Engineering for Engineers Workshop**. Each codebase is designed to give hands-on practice with applying prompts to real-world coding tasks using AI tools like GitHub Copilot or Gemini.

## Workshop Overview

Participants in this workshop have already completed the *Prompt Engineering for Engineers* course. This workshop focuses on applying prompt engineering techniques to solve more advanced and practical problems in code.

## Challenges

### 1. Deep Code Quality Analysis
_Refactor and document a performance-critical function_

**Scenario:** Youâ€™re working with a legacy codebase that filters and aggregates user analytics. It is inefficient and hard to read. Use AI to help you improve this codebase for clarity, maintainability or readability

### 2. Extend a Codebase Thoughtfully
_Add new features and improve test coverage_

**Scenario:** The given codebase lacks observability, and you're tasked with implementing structured logging and test cases for each function, including edge cases

### 3. Reverse Engineer an Unknown Codebase
_Understand a new module and propose a refactor plan_

**Scenario:** You've inherited a billing module written by a previous team. It's undocumented and business-critical

## Workshop Sections

### 1. Code Quality
Practice writing prompts to:
- Improve code readability
- Add meaningful comments and documentation
- Refactor and simplify logic

### 2. Extending a Codebase
Practice prompts to:
- Add new functions and files
- Implement new features
- Extend test coverage

### 3. Learning About a Codebase
Practice prompts to:
- Summarize code behavior
- Ask questions about functionality
- Discover areas for improvement

## Codebase Languages

Each section is implemented in multiple languages for broader practice:

| Section             | Python | JavaScript | Java | C# | Go |
|---------------------|--------|------------|------|----|----|

## ðŸš€ How to Use

To use this repository as a template for your own workshop or personal practice, follow these simple steps:

1. **Click on "Use this template"**:
   - On the main page of the repository, click the green **"Use this template"** button.
   - This will create a **new repository** with the same codebase, directory structure, and files as this template.

2. **Customize Your Repository**:
   - You can now customize the content, add your own prompts, and use it as part of your training or workshop materials.
   - Feel free to modify the code, add new files, or make changes to fit your own needs.

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Once your new repository is created, clone it to your local machine by using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git
     ```

4. **Start Prompt Engineering**:
   - Open the codebase in your preferred code editor.
   - Use AI tools (like GitHub Copilot or Cursor) to practice prompt engineering:
     - Improve code quality
     - Extend the functionality
     - Learn about and explore the codebase
